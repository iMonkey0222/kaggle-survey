# Kaggle Survey Analysis

As someone with a growing interest in data science, I'll be writing a [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) detailing some of my findings from their [data science survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017). Until I've finished writing and finding new things to share, you can view my progress by using GitHub's built-in Jupyter notebook viewer, by clicking the [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/jackcook/kaggle-survey/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) file.
